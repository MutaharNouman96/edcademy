                        Ed-Cademy was created by educators who understand the real
                        demands of teaching, tutoring, and educational leadership.
                        Our founding team brings years of experience from classrooms,
                        international schools, online learning programs, and academic
                        leadership roles.

                    <p class="text-muted">
                        In today’s education landscape, content is everywhere—but
                        quality, credibility, and effectiveness are often difficult
                        for families and learners to evaluate. At the same time,
                        educators frequently face unfair compensation, limited
                        recognition, and little control over how their work is
                        distributed and valued.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted">
                        Ed-Cademy was built to solve both challenges.
